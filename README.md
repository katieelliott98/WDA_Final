Project by Kaitlyn Elliott

Final project for Water Data Analytics at Duke University Nicholas School of the Environment Spring of 2022. 

This project focuses on three main questions: 
1. How is groundwater levels and stormflow changing overtime? Is there seasonality?
2. How does storm flow impact groundwater levels?
3. How is groundwater quality changing overtime? Are chemicals more concentrated at
low groundwater levels or high?

All datasets used are from the USGS. They include discharge data, groundwater levels, and groundwater quality measurements. 

Limitation of the project include the lack of precipitation gauge data, so stormflow was extracted from discharge data as a proxy.
